			<h2> Mind the Gap: How NIL is Changing College Sports in the D.C. Area.</h2>
			<h4> by Hannah Urdanick </h4></section>
			<main class="everything">
		<section>
			<P>Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL, has already reshaped college sports nationwide, giving athletes the right to profit from their personal brands. Allowing college athletes to be paid for their work brings those high level recruits to certain schools… and keeps them away from others. NIL is directly tied to funding—leaving lower funded schools at a disadvantage.</P>

<p>As of Nov. 25, B26-0175 is set to legalize NIL in the District is <a href="https://lims.dccouncil.gov/Legislation/B26-0175"> set to enter into law after being signed by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.</a></p>

<p>This bill would finally allow athletes compensation through NIL money. This could reshape funding for athletic programs throughout the D.C. area—especially for District schools that already fall behind powerhouse programs in Maryland and Virginia. The change could also vastly impact Women’s sports.</p> 

<p>The question is, what will those changes look like?</p>

			<h3> <main class="subhead">What is NIL?</main> </h3>
			<p>Name, Image and Likeness refers to the right for college athletes to earn money from endorsements, brand partnerships and other commercial uses of their identity—even jerseys. 

<p>NIL was <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/41040485/what-nil-college-sports-how-do-athlete-deals-work"> approved by the NCAA in 2021</a> in a landmark rule change, ending a decades long system that barred athletes from profiting off of their own image. This is the first time college athletes have been allowed to profit directly from their work. Signing onto NCAA sports meant giving up those profit rights for athletes in the past.</p>

<p>The change has also complicated funding and recruiting. Athletes might seek out schools with larger fanbases—and therefore more advertising opportunities—while some institutions have created NIL support programs and experiences in order to attract lucrative recruits.</p>

<p>All of these benefits for athletes looking for good NIL deals come from the same kind of school: <i>Well funded</i>. Disparities between smaller—and therefore less advertising opportunities—often begin to widen. </p>

			<h3> <main class="subhead"> How does it affect the D.C. Area? </main></h3>
			<p>If there’s two things Georgetown University is known for, its political aspiration and basketball. The former Syracuse rivals dominated in the 80s and 90s, producing NBA stars and household names such as Allen Iverson.</p>

<p>Here in the 20s, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/data/data-file/2019-20-common-core-data-ccd-universe-files"> Georgetown lags behind D.C. area neighbors and competitors such as the University of Maryland, the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech.</a></p>

<p>The reason? Funding.</p>

<p>Georgetown no longer has the influence to cultivate the strong NIL programs Maryland, Virginia Tech, and UVA run. It can no longer match or even come close to the recruiting budgets, coaching salaries or NIL infrastructure that these schools have, according to Department of Education data.</p>

<p>Georgetown is the highest earning higher education institute in D.C., but doesn’t even come close to the top earners in Maryland and Virginia.</p>

<p>Virginia Tech, the University of Virginia and the University of Maryland all lead in both revenue and coaching salaries. Each brought in over $130 million of athletic revenue in 2024, with Maryland garnering a $139 million dollar profit. All three are located pretty far from D.C.’s city limits.</p>

<p>Georgetown, meanwhile, had $58 million in revenue—a gap that limits its ability to compete for recruits in the NIL era.</p>

<p>Several factors could contribute to that divide: Georgetown is restricted to the small city limits of the District, while UVA and Virginia Tech sprawl in rural Virginia. D.C. in general is a much smaller city, and Georgetown can’t rely on the draw of being a state school like UVA and Maryland can.</p>

<p>Why, then, was Georgetown’s basketball program so well known a few decades ago? One explanation could be that programs simply change—Syracuse has experienced that same fall with missing March Madness repeatedly when years ago that would’ve been impossible. Coaches and players come and go, especially when some often leave after a short time for the big leagues.</p> 

<p>While program success can rise and fall over time, the financial gap has widened since NIL rules took effect 4 years ago.</p>

<p>“(NIL) takes away from smaller schools with less fans or notable alumni, making it harder to recruit top athletes and in the long term ultimately eliminate these smaller schools from the competition,” says Syracuse Sports Analyst Kate Bradley. “It's no longer just about facilities or tradition, recruiting is about providing competitive economic opportunities.”</p>

<p>It all comes back to money.</p>

			<p>In 2024, Georgetown spent about $424,000 on recruiting across sports.</p>

<p>According to Department of Education data, the University of Maryland spent more than that on women’s programs alone, totaling roughly $704,000. Their recruiting expenses total was $2.4 <i>million</i>. This total includes spending on things like NIL deals—everything and anything that will draw a player to their school.</p>

<p>Georgetown draws behind these Maryland and Virginia behemoths for a lot of reasons, but a significant one that can’t be denied is the lack of NIL draw. Georgetown was already behind pre-NIL in 2020… but not as behind as it is now. The school’s total recruiting expense was a little over $1 million. Maryland was only ahead by $400,000 at the time with $1.4 million total recruitment spending.</p> 

<p>That’s a $600,000 difference in funding for Georgetown.</p>

<p>That marked shift happens immediately with the NCAA’s 2021 rule change.</p>

<p>Money in the DMV already flows unevenly—NIL has begun to widen that gap.</p>

<p>That gap can also greatly be seen between women’s versus men’s sports. Throughout all four of these schools, not a single one spends over $700,000 on recruitment expenses. Average expenses per participant in the region is around $86,000. Men’s programs outspend women’s by $17,000 per participant on average.</p>

<p>And that’s not even looking at coaching expenses. </p>

			<h3> <main class="subhead"> What does this mean? </main></h3>
			<p>According to <a href="http://dcnewsnow.com"> dcnewsnow.com,</a> passage of the NIL bill could help draw talented athletes to local schools and help keep the ones already here out of the transfer portal.</p>

<p>If schools like Georgetown have to spend less on organic recruitment and can instead encourage NIL, that’s more money to spend elsewhere. This could go towards growing the program with recruitment expenses elsewhere, towards hiring better coaches, or even towards underserved programs like Georgetown’s Women’s teams.</p>

<p>According to the NIL store’s online representation, NIL deals open pathways up for underrepresented athletes. Women’s sports has seen a growth since the start/increase of NIL deals with athletes like Paige Beuckers. Again, if Women’s sports see more cash flow, there’s nowhere to go but up.</p>

<p>College athletes generate far more revenue than is given back to them—top area schools earned over $130k per participant while only giving back around $17k on average in athlete aid. NIL money allows athletes to support themselves without relying solely on scholarships or school aid. Women’s sports become more accessible for athletes when they don’t have to <a href="https://iconsource.com/blog/empowering-women-in-college-sports/"> rely on scholarships </a>that are significantly smaller than their men’s counterparts. Gaps close when athletes can support themselves.</p>

<p>Shannon Scovel of the University of Maryland says "Every woman in the NCAA now has a platform and the ability to share their story," in an interview with <a href="https://iconsource.com/blog/empowering-women-in-college-sports/"> iconsource.com.</a></p>

<p>With B26-0175’s passage, NIL’s entry could determine whether schools in the District catch up with the rest of the region, or whether the gap continues to widen.</p>
