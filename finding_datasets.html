<li><strong>How is this data organized and collected?</strong> The data is organized into a spreadsheet and collected by institutions submitting data. They are required to do so by the U.S. Department of Athletics</li>
<li><strong>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</strong> The data set contains information about the amount of coaches, the expenses of teams categorized by gender, and other gender-related sports data at a number of institutions, including Syracuse University. Thatâ€™s not information members of the public often knows. Syracuse University students would be the best audience for a story.</li> 
<li></li><strong>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</strong> Female coaches (including assistant and head coach positions), on average, are paid less than male coaches at Syracuse University.</li></ol>

      <p>Link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattop/nhl-draft-hockey-player-data-1963-2022" target="_blank"> NHL draft data since 1963</a>
<ol>
<li><strong>How is this data organized and collected?</strong> The data is organized based on draft order in each draft year, earliest 1963 and latest 2022. It is collected from publicly available draft statistics.</li>
<li><strong>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</strong> It is newsworthy based on how the National Hockey League has changed over time and how more immigrants have come from around the world to contribute to the league. This is a hot button issue with how recent policy has targeted immigration. The best audience would be hockey fans and people interested in immigration issues.</li> 
<li><strong>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</strong> The majority of NHL draftees are from Canada and the US, but as time has gone on since 1963, more draftees have come from a number of different countries and continue to be drafted in higher and higher positions, compared to lower draft positions in years past.</li></ol>
