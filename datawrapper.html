		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p>D.C. is likely about to pass a bill that will un-ban NIL deals for college athletes in Washington. NIL deals have a big impact on attracting talented athletes to certain areas and giving less-represented athletes an opprotuinity to be represented. It also greatly impacts funding for the school's athletic program. This chart shows the difference in funding, specifically for Men's versus Women's coaching salaries, as an example of how funding is different between genders.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP TWO: Add the photo of your sketched chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual photo to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="chart-sketch.JPG" alt="Coaching salaries, Men's versus Women's." height="300px" width="400px">
		

		<!-- STEP THREE: Add the screenshot of your first Datawrapper chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual screenshot to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="chart-draft1.png" alt="a map of Syracuse" height="300px" width="400px">

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p>I needed to add more specification on location into the actual headline instead of the sub-head and change the color choices. The feedback specifically wanted me to increase the contrast between the two colors to better demonstrate the contrast between salaries.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<iframe title="Women's coaches are paid over $800k less on average in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia." aria-label="Stacked column chart" id="datawrapper-chart-KhS97" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KhS97/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="458" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>I increased the contrast between colors and changed the headline to include location information.</p>
